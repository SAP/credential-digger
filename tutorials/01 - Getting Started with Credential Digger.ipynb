    "Data protection has become an important issue over the last few years. In such an environment, one of the most critical threats is represented by hardcoded (or plaintext) credentials in open-source projects. Several tools are already available to detect leaks in open-source platforms but the diversity of credentials (depending on multiple factors such as the programming language, code development conventions, or developers' personal habits) is a bottleneck for the effectiveness of these tools. Their lack of precision leads to a very high number of pieces of code detected as leaked secrets, even though they consist in perfectly legitimate code. Data wrongly detected as a leak is called *false positive data*, and compose the huge majority of the data detected by currently available tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of Credential Digger is to reduce the amount of false positive data on the output of the scanning phase, by leveraging machine learning models"

    "Credential Digger relies on several components:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **Regex Scanner** (or Scanner) is the basic component because it provides the regular expression scan on the GitHub repositories. In the installation, you configured a set of rules (from the .yml file) and it is still possible to add/remove your own rules\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **Path Model**: A lot of the discoveries are in example files such as documentations, README, etc. since it is very common for developers to provide test codes for their projects. The Path Model analyzes the *path* of each discovery and classifies it as false positive when needed\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **Snippet Models**: Now, we are tackling the most difficult part to detect a false positive: the code snippet. Two steps are required: a pre-processing step (called **Extractor**) and classification step (called **Classifier**). The output of the Classifier will contain the discoveries with a reduced amount of false positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, a user can review the filtered discoveries by *flagging* a discovery as false positive (see in later sections). The machine learning models can be enabled or disabled, depending on your use case. For more advanced users, it is possible to integrate your own model directly to Credential Digger."
