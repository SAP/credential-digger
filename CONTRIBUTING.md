## How to contribute code

You are welcome to contribute code to Credential Digger in order to fix issues
or to add new features.

### Contribution process

- Check the `develop` branch and make sure that the issue/feature you want to
  work on has not been solved yet.
- Fork the Credential Digger repository to your GitHub account.
- You must follow the coding style as best you can when submitting code.
  Take note of naming conventions, separation of concerns, and formatting
  rules.
  - For Python (i.e., the main programming language used in this project),
    follow the pep8 style guide. You can use code fixers to handle this in a
    simple way (we suggest `autopep8` and `yapf`).
- Create a Pull Request from your forked repository to
  `github.com/SAP/credential-digger`. In the subject of the pull request,
  briefly describe the bug fix or enhancement you're contributing.
  In the pull request description, please provide a link to the issue in the
  issue tracker. 
- Follow the link posted by the CLA assistant to your pull request and accept
  the DCO.
- Wait for our code review and approval. We may ask you for additional commits,
  or make changes to your pull request ourselves. Please be patient!
- Once the change has been approved, we inform you in a comment.
- We close the pull request. You can then delete the now obsolete branch.

### Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)
Due to legal reasons, contributors will be asked to accept a DCO before they
submit the first pull request to this projects, this happens in an automated
fashion during the submission process. SAP uses [the standard DCO text of the
Linux Foundation](https://developercertificate.org/).
